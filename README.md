# good-solitaire

This is my submission for the technical test. All in all it took just over a day.

The .apk is available in the "Builds" folder.

All of the 3rd party assets, such as sprites, fonts and scripts, are all freely available.
Note that I usually use some paid assets which I could not use here, notably 
Odin Inspector: I opted to use an open source alternative instead.

While there is obvious polish that can be done, such as tweens & audio, I trust
that the current codebase convinces you that these things are no problem.

Enjoy the project!
